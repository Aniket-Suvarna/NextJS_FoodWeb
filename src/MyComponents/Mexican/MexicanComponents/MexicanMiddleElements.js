     to order out. Deep-frying them at home? Not so much. Instead, these zucchini fries 
     are packed full of the flavor you love without a drop of oil. We coat them in a cheesy, garlicky 
     mixture before baking over high heat, giving them an ultra-crispy crust, perfect for dunking in your
      favorite sauce. They're also so easy to whip up, only taking around 30 minutes for a delicious side
       everyone will be grabbing for, whether you serve them alongside, say, pasta pomodoro and garlic bread or 
       Buffalo wings and nachos on game day."

title2="PEPPERMINT MERINGUE"

bodycont2="A cookie box filled with a wide assortment of shapes, 
sizes and colors is such a treat to gift during the holidays. These 
peppermint meringues are the perfect addition to add a pop of color and fun. 
They practically scream “holiday!” and they taste fantastic as well. Nestle them 
alongside our Christmas tree cookies, our gingerbread people, and our sweet and salty 
holiday toffee for a crowd-pleasing arrangement.

Although they look impressive, the recipe is very simple. You'll make a basic meringue
 and flavor it with a touch of peppermint extract. To achieve the candy striping, you paint
  the inside of a piping bag with stripes of red gel food coloring before filling it with the
   fluffy meringue. A food-specific paint brush helps get the right-size thin stripes, but if you don't
    have one, use the thin edge of a pastry brush or the tip of a table knife ."
