    quintessential Italian Sunday dinner for the family. This dish brings back memories of my childhood. 
    I think my Mom made the best, and I tried to recreate her recipe here. In the video I show you how to 
    pound the chicken breasts thin and even for better frying, and how to bread the cutlets with a traditional 
    method of flour, egg wash, and seasoned breadcrumbs. Every Italian home cook should know how to make classic 
    Chicken Parmesan (Parmigiano). It requires pounding the chicken breasts to a thin and even size, and breading 
    them with traditional flour, egg wash, and seasoned breadcrumbs. Use whole-milk mozzarella if you can for that extra buttery flavor."

        title2="ROSEMARY MUSHROOM RISOTTO"

        bodycont2="This rosemary mushroom risotto is creamy, luxurious, and incredibly satisfying, this dish 
        is a quintessential classic. There are many different variations out there and one of the more popular 
        combinations is with mushrooms and peas. Sounds good to me! In my vegan rendition, since we are not adding 
        any dairy cheese or cream, I like to create a strong depth of flavor with mustard and miso (a trick I learned 
          while working as a server in a restaurant in NYC). The tang from the mustard and cheesiness from the miso works
           wonders for the creamy rice known as ‘Arborio’. My other secret weapon is rosemary. This powerful herb offers a 
           very strong savory flavor that is earthy and robust. It works beautifully with rice and mushrooms. In regards to 
           risotto, I think people are intimidated, but I am here to prove to all of you that it’s really not that bad! Matter 
           of fact, it’s quite simple. The most important ingredient is time. Instead of cooking the grains in one large amount 
           of water all at the same time, you slowly add it, little by little. The rice slowly absorbs the liquid and the result 
           is a luxuriously creamy dish. The key here is to only add a warm liquid so that it cooks perfectly. That’s why you heat
            up the vegetable broth before cooking. As for the veggies, I like to add asparagus and blanched fava beans for a nice 
            crunch and variation in texture, but you could add whatever vegetables you like. Frozen peas work beautifully! When making 
            this rosemary mushroom risotto, I recommend serving it immediately as that’s when it’s best. A crusty piece of bread works
             as the perfect vehicle to help scrape the sides of bowl- just sayin’."
