                            restaurant method of actually grilling my chicken before adding it to a luscious tomato
                            sauce fragrant with spices and finished with butter and cream. Indian restaurants simply use
                            the previous day’s tandoori chicken in the sauce for the night day, there by avoiding waste and
                            re-purposing it as a new dish. Not only does the spices and smokey flavor of the chicken add to the
                            flavor of the sauce, but the sauce also re hydrates the grilled chicken and keeps it juicy and tender.
                            If you taste a version of butter chicken where raw chicken is simply added to sauce, versus a grilled spiced
                            chicken added to the sauce you’ll really appreciate that extra step of grilling the meat."

        bodycont2="In India, we refer to goat meat as “Mutton” and sheep meat as “Lamb”. So when you see mutton on the menu 
across the country, it is referring to goat meat. From what I gather, this isn’t technically the same 
terminology used here, where both ‘lamb’ and ‘mutton’ are sheep meat and the only distinction is the age of the sheep when 
processed. The meat from sheep under one year is called ‘Lamb’ and the meat of sheep 
older (usually 2-3 years) is called ‘Mutton’.  Anyway whatever the technical terms are… goat, lamb, and 
mutton are all delicious and underrated meats here in the U.S.  For this recipe, we used fresh raised Goat 
meat, but you can easily substitute with lamb or beef (although beef won’t have the same flavor, it’s still
delicious)."
