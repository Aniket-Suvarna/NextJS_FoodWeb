    cont="Italian cuisine has a tradition of dishes based on wheat products (such as bread and pasta), vegetables, cheese, fish, and meat, usually prepared in such a manner as to preserve their ingredients' natural qualities, appearance, and taste.

    This kind of cuisine puts a stress on lightness and healthy nutrition with natural unprocessed foods, and tends to vary greatly not only with the seasons but also between the various regions of the country: mountainous regions have dishes rich in proteins, and prefer meat, butter, and cheese, while seaside regions have dishes rich in vegetables and fish.
    
    In this way, the cuisine is born of the people, the territory and the seasons, and is not pulled out of nowhere for no rhyme or reason."

    title1="Cooking Techniques"
    his="Italian cuisine mainly comes from people who worked long hours and had limited resources. Thus, as fancy as their dishes may appear, their cooking techniques are rather simple. And if one analyzes the cuisine in-depth, you would come to know that in reality, there are very few intricate dishes.

    Some of the common cooking techniques used by Italians include:
    
    1.Boiling or simmering
    2.Pan Frying or pan roasting
    3.Grilling
    4.Braising"

    title2="Meal Pattern"

    intr="Italians view mealtimes as opportunities for spending time with loved ones. Hence, their mealtime lasts longer than average. On unique occasions like Christmas and New Year, the meal times even last for hours.

    Aperitivo (Appetizer)
    ,Antipasto (Appetizer served right before the meal)

    ,Secondo (Second or main dish)
